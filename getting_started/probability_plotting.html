<p>The estimated probabilities can now be presented in a probability plot. With <code>plot_prob()</code> probability plots for several lifetime distributions can be constructed and estimates of multiple methods can be displayed at once. The axes are transformed in such a way that the <em>cumulative distribution function (CDF)</em> is represented through a straight line. If the plotted probabilities lie on an approximately straight line it can be said that the chosen distribution is adequate.</p>
