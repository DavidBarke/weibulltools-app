{weibulltools} comes with two basic methods for the parameter estimation of lifetime distributions. Whereas `rank_regression()` fits a straight line through the plotting positions of the calculated failure probabilites, `ml_estimation()` strives to maximize a function of the parameters given the sample data. `rank_regression()` and `ml_estimation()` can be applied to complete data as well as failure and (multiple) right-censored data. Both methods can also deal with three-parametric models that include a threshold parameter $\gamma$.
