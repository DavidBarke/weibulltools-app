The estimated probabilities can now be presented in a probability plot. For the sake of simplicity we assume that the estimation of failure probabilities was done with `methods = johnson`. With `plot_prob()` probability plots for several lifetime distributions can be constructed and estimates of multiple methods can be displayed at once. The axes are transformed in such a way that the _cumulative distribution function (CDF)_ is represented through a straight line. If the plotted probabilities lie on an approximately straight line it can be said that the chosen distribution is adequate.
